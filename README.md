# REU at University of Colorado Boulder
Here you will find all my work for my Summer of 2020 internship at University of Colorado Boulder. My mentors were Craig DeForest of the Southwest Research Institute, and Barbara Thompson of Nasa Goddard.

# Porting PDL into Python 3
The majority of the summer was spent porting parts of Perl Data Language(PDL), which was written by Dr. DeForest, into Python 3. The reason for porting this was because the data pipeline for the upcoming PUNCH mission was written in PDL. However, PDL is not a very well known language, so to make the PUNCH more accessable, we agreed to port it into Python 3. Below you can see a poster of what I did over the course of the summer.
